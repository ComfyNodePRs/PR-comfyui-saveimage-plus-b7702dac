# SaveImage Plus

- This custom node is largely identical to the usual Save Image but allows saving images also in JPEG and WEBP formats, the latter with both lossless and lossy compression.
- Metadata is embedded in the images as usual, and the resulting images can be used to load a workflow.
- Added an option to remove metadata from the saved images.

## Installation

To install, clone this repository into the `ComfyUI/custom_nodes` folder with:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Goktug/comfyui-saveimage-plus
```

This update reflects the new feature allowing the removal of metadata from saved images.
