# SaveImage Plus

- This custom node is largely identical to the usual Save Image but allows saving images also in JPEG and WEBP formats, the latter with both lossless and lossy compression.
- Metadata is embedded in the images as usual, and the resulting images can be used to load a workflow.
- Added an option to remove metadata from the saved images.
